        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a chain refers to a sequence of steps or operations that are linked together to complete a task.\n",
        "Think of it as running Step1 ‚Üí Step2 ‚Üí Step3 in a connected workflow, instead of just calling the LLM directly.\n",
        "Chains help in building more structured, complex, and scalable applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## üõ†Ô∏è Types of Chains\n",
        "### 1. Sequential (or Linear) Chaining\n",
        "\n",
        "Each step is executed one after the other in a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Writing an outline ‚Üí Expanding it into paragraphs ‚Üí Summarizing the content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Parallel Chaining\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple tasks are executed at the same time to save time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Preparing lunch ‚Üí Cutting vegetables, boiling pasta, and making sauce all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Conditional Chaining\n",
        "\n",
        "The next task depends on a condition or decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a user‚Äôs feedback is positive ‚Üí Generate a thank-you note.\n",
        "Otherwise ‚Üí Create an apology with an improvement plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, chains provide flexibility and efficiency in building real-world AI workflows.\n"
